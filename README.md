The [first notebook](/1-generating-samples-from-1D-gaussian.ipynb) in this series tackles a very simple problem: generating samples from a normal distribution.
It serves as a tool to understand GAN basics. The notebook exposes the reader to a well-documented GAN implementation in TensorFlow's eager mode.
